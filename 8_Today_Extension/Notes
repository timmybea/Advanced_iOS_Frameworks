Add Today Extension
Click on project file and select: file > new > target > today extension
click "activate" when prompted.


Now we want to be able to reuse some of the code from our project target in our today extension target. Do this by creating a bridging header.
file > new > target > cocoa touch framework.

Next we need to add the code that we want to our bridging header. Do this by selecting the file and then opening the file inspector to the right of the screen. You will see an area called target membership. Simply unselect the file from the project and select it in the bridging header.

Once you have done that you will have some errors in your project wherever those files that are now in the bridging header are used. simply "import" the bridging header at the top of the file.

Common errors to watch out for:

Deployment targets need to be the same for all of the targets. You can do this by clicking on the project file and selecting the different targets at the left of the screen and then changing any deployment targets that are not what you want.

You need to makee sure that you define your classes as public if you want them to be seen from the bridging header.
